# This is a configuration file for the SDMs. It's used to configure (1) the groups
# for which to obtain the SDMs and (2) the variables to use when fitting the SDMs
# YAML files use the identation to establish list levels, so it's important to keep it consistent
# Don't use tabulation, use 2 spaces instead.

# Fill here with the conditions to get the groups.
# For example, the group photosynthesizers have to met the condition
# kingdom == 'Chromista' | kingdom == 'Plantae'
# For character, use single ''
groups:
  sea_anemones: order == 'Actiniaria'
  anemonefish: genus == 'Amphiprion'
  
  
  
# Put here the list of variables that will be used for each group
# The order is variables (don't edit) > group name (should be equal to the previous section) > 'hypothesis' > list of variables
# setting an hypothesis ("name of hypothesis") is useful if you want to test multiple variables settings
# If you want to use a single hypothesis, simple leave only one hypothesis.
# Names of variable should be written on the format NAME_VARIANT(e.g. mean, min, max)
# So, for example, to get the mean temperature for the sea we would set: thetao_mean
# Example:
# variables:
#  fishes:
#    hypothesis1:
#      - variable1_mean
#      - variable2_max
#    hypothesis2:
#      - variable2_max
#      - variable3_min
